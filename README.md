## Description

This project was built to help me practice and understand semantic html and the importance of not repeating oneself. In this project I added all semantic HTML to the index file and make some parts of the CSS cleaner by cleaning up parts where it repeated itself. So once again I leared the importance of semantic HTML and clean code.
